Assignment 6
3D Orrery with Lighting

For this assignment, I implemented lighting in the 3D orrery constructed
for assignment 5. To do this, I constructed a normal array consisting of
a normal for each vertex calculated by extending the normal out from the 
center of the sphere, created a normal matrix from the modelview matrix
using the normalMatrix function from MV.js, and then computed per-vertex 
lighting in the vertex shader.

I also added sliders to control the color of the lighting applied to the
planets. These work by simply updating the color components of the
ambient, diffuse, and specular components of light each time one of the
slider values is changed.

To run the program, open orrery-3d.html in a web browser and use the
controls below the canvas to adjust the color of the light. Everything
works as expected.
