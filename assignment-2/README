Assignment 2 - 2D Ping-Pong Game

For this assignment, I constructed a simple 2D ping-pong game consisting of a ball
and a paddle, controlled using HTML buttons in the document. I programmed the game
logic and animation in my javascript file, sending the centers and colors of the ball
and paddle to the shaders as uniform variables and then rendering them as
"gl.TRIANGLE_FAN"s. I tested the program by spending some time playing it, and
everything is working as intended, including the buttons to change the ball's speed,
the display of the number of times the ball has bounced off the paddle, and the
performance of the ball and paddle.
