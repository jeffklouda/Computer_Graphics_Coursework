Assignment 1

To complete this assignment, I based my solution on the code we wrote in 
class to create multiple triangles with different uniform colors. I 
specified the vertices and colors required for the triangles, intialized
WebGL, loaded the data into the GPU using a data buffer, and then used 
gl.uniform3fv() to specify the color and gl.drawArrays to draw the triangles
as well as the black lines around the triangles.

I identified the vertices of the triangles from the guides given on the 
assignment page and their colors using the color-dropper in Firefox's 
Inspector tool. These values are repeated below.

Triangle vertices and colors:
