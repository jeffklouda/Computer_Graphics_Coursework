Assignment 8: Rendering Realistic Orange
11/13/2017

For this assignment I implemented per-fragment lighting and normal 
mapping using the given template files which included an obj file for
the orange model, an orange image texture, an orange normal map, an obj
parser script, and shader and JavaScript code which implemented texture
mapping on the orange.

I began by adding per-fragment lighting, calculating the eye and light 
vectors per vertex in eye space, passing them on to the fragment shader,
and then calculating lighting per the Phong Equation. I then implemented 
the normal mapping by calculating the per-vertex tangent and bitangent in 
eye space and used those vectors along with the normal vector to get the 
the light and eye vectors in tangent space. I passed these values on to 
fragment shader and then used them, along with the normal vector 
referenced from the normal map for each fragment, to calculate lighting
with the normal map.

Finally, I added radio buttons to the HTML document that allow the user to switch between the different rendering modes.

To run the program, open orange.html using a web browser and use the radio
buttons at the bottom of the page to change how the orange is rendered. 
The program behaves completely as expected.
