Assignment 3

For this assignment I constructed the clock face as specified in the
assignment 3 document. My vertices vector contained the vertices for a 
circle of radius 1 and a 1 by 1 square, which I used to construct all the 
forms in the clock face. To transform the vertices I used 3 transformation 
matrices for the circles outerMat, innerMat, and centerMat that scaled the 
circle to the appropriate sizes. For the hour ticks I created a 12 element 
hourMarkerMats array conatining the transformation matrix for each tick. 
Each tick is first scaled to the appropiate shape (from the 1x1 square 
vertices), tranlated to the edge of the clock face, and then rotated in 30 
degree increments. The minute ticks are transformed in the same way using 
the 60 element minuteMarkerMats array, but are scaled smaller and rotated in 
6 degree increments. I sent all of these matrices to the vertex shader using 
the gl.uniformMatrix4fv() function and the colors of each element to the 
fragment shader using gl.uniform3fv() before drawing each circle or square 
using gl.drawArrays().
The program works as intended, displaying a clock face similar to the example
given in the assignment document. To run the program, open clockFace.html
using the Firefox browser.
