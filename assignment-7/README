Assignment 7: 3D Orrery with Texturing
11/13/2017

For this assignment, I added texturing to my assignment 7 implementation of the
orrery with lighting. To do this, I calculated vertex texture coordinates in 
the setupSphere() function using the u and v calculations given in the assignment
document, initialized textures for each planet using the given jpg files, and
then sent the texture coordinates to the shader programs to determine the final
fragment color by multiplying the texture color by the lighting color. The most
difficult part of this assignment was figuring out how to initialize multiple 
textures and then swap between them when rendering different objects.

To run the program, open orrery-3d.html in a web browser and then use the
controls below the canvas to influence the rendering and click and drag on
the canvas to rotate the scene. Everything is behaving as expected.
