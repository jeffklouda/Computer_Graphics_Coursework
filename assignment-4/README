For this assignment I added animated hour, minute, and second hands to the 
clock face I constructed in Assignment 3. To do this, I created three new 
transformation matrices hourMat, minuteMat, and secondMat which I applied to 
the same square that I used to create the hour and minute ticks on my clock 
face. In my main function, I multilpied three new scaling matrices by the 
ctm to scale each hand to the proper dimensions, and then translated each so 
that it extended from the center of the clock toward the 12 hour mark.

In the rendering function, I created a js Date object and then got the hour, 
minute and second values from it. I then multiplied each transformation 
matrix by a rotation matrix to rotate each hand to the proper angle. Because 
these matrices are calculated every frame, the rotations are automatically 
updated, and I can simply call requestAnimFrame(render) to get the next frame.

The program works as intended, displaying an animated clock that updates its 
minute and second hands every second and its hour hand every minute similar 
to the example given in the assignment document. To run the program, open 
clock.html using the Firefox browser.
