Assignment 5 - 3D Orrery

I began this assignment by building off the code provided in the
orrery-3D-template files. I created the transformation matrices for all the
planets by first translating them away from the sun by their orbit distance
and then rotating them on the Y axis based on the angle offset determined
by the current day. I created the transformation matrix for the Moon using
the same method and then multiplying by Earth's transformation matrix to 
center the Moon's orbit around the Earth. I calculated the matrix for the
circle drawn fo the Moon's orbit using the same method.

In addition to this, I implemented the trackball functionality using the 
example code from class, and I implemented the various HTML control elements
below the Canvas element. I implemented their functionality for the Orbit On
and Orbit Off options by simply not calling the drawOrbits() function when 
Orbit On is not checked, the animation on/off options by not incrementing the
current day when Animation On is not checked, the day on/off options by
changing the innerHTML of day element based on which option is selected, and
the inc/dec days per frame buttons by doubling or halving days per frame when
each is pressed.

Everything is working as expected. To run the program, run orrery-3D.html 
in a web browser.
